# AI & ML Internship – Task 5
## Decision Trees & Random Forests

### Objective
Learn tree-based models for classification & regression, visualize decision trees, evaluate performance, and interpret feature importance.

### Dataset
- Dataset Used: Heart Disease Dataset
- Source: GitHub (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ekawouw/heart-disease-uci/main/heart.csv)

### Tools
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Graphviz
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

### Steps Performed
1. Loaded and preprocessed the dataset.
2. Trained a Decision Tree classifier.
3. Visualized the Decision Tree.
4. Controlled overfitting using max_depth.
5. Trained a Random Forest and compared accuracy with Decision Tree.
6. Interpreted feature importance using Random Forest.
7. Evaluated the model using 5-fold cross-validation.

### Results
- Decision Tree Accuracy: XX%
- Random Forest Accuracy: YY%
- Cross-Validation Accuracy: ZZ%
- Feature importance plot generated.

### Insights
- Random Forest performed better due to ensemble learning.
- Most important features: list top features
- Overfitting controlled by limiting tree depth.
